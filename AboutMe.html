    <p>Hey everybody, I'm a 'Brigham Young University Idaho' Student 
        everyone else in this class, majoring in software engineering. 
        I like to right now I like to play video games and watch 
        better call saul. I'm pursuing a bacholors degree and I hope to
        get that done after I get home from my mission.

        I am not married, I have no children, I am an oldest sibling.
        I want to go work at intel in my home town of folsom. 
        The thing I love most about BYUI is not the Rexburg part I'll say that much, :)
        but I love how the teachers connect with the students and teach on a personal level.
        Web design is good because HTML and CSS is another programming thing that's good to know.
        I want to learn some web stuff for my website I was working on for nfts and games.

        I have been a member of the church since I was a child, my parents are no longer members. 
        I don't have a favorite quote but my favorite talk is any elder Uchtdorf talk ever.
        I don't have a favorite scripture or anything else, but I do want to recomend that everyone who
        hasn't watched 'Arrested development', to go watch that show.
